Inheritance is an important part of the OOPS concept. In inheritance, we define parent and child 
classes. The child class can inherit all the methods, objects and properties of the parent class. 
A child class can also have its own methods and specific implementation.
The parent class is also known as a base class and the child class that inherits the base class 
is also known as derived class.

public class ParentClass {
    public ParentClass() {
        Console.WriteLine("Parent Constructor.");
    }
    public void print() {
        Console.WriteLine("I'm a Parent Class.");
    }
}
public class ChildClass: ParentClass {
    public ChildClass() {
        Console.WriteLine("Child Constructor.");
    }
    public static void Main() {
        ChildClass child = new ChildClass();
        child.print();
    }
}

Output

Parent Constructor.
Child Constructor.
I'm a Parent Class.
