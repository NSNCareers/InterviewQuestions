Float: 
      In programming, a floating-point or float is a variable type that is used to store floating-point 
number values. A floating-point number is one where the position of the decimal point can "float" rather 
than being in a fixed position within a number. Examples of floating-point numbers are 1.23, 87.425, and 
9039454.2. A float is a data type composed of a number that is not an integer, because it includes a 
fraction represented in decimal format.
